# Chart

`Chart.Root` holds the data and the scales of a chart. It controls the focus and the selection of the points. `Chart.Title` names the chart, and `Chart.Plot` makes the SVG that holds the marks and the guides.

<Demo source={heroSource}><Hero /></Demo>

## Anatomy

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { Chart } from '@human-kit/charts';
</script>

<Chart.Root data={rows} x="month" y="visits" series="site">
	<Chart.Title>Visits per month</Chart.Title>
	<Chart.Plot>
		<Chart.Grid />
		<Chart.Axis position="bottom" />
		<Chart.Axis position="left" />
		<Chart.Line />
	</Chart.Plot>
	<Chart.Legend />
	<Chart.Tooltip />
	<Chart.DataTable />
</Chart.Root>
```

`Chart.Root` makes a `<figure>`. `Chart.Title` makes its `<figcaption>`. `Chart.Plot` makes the `<svg>`. The marks and the guides go in the plot. The legend, the tooltip and the data table are HTML, thus they go next to the plot.

## Data and channels

Give the rows in `data`. A mark uses them when it has no `data` of its own.

`x`, `y` and `series` are channels. A channel is the name of a field of the row, or a function of the row and its index. The field names are typed: `x="month"` is a type error when the row has no `month` field.

A value of a channel is a number, a `Date`, or a string. A string is a category of a band scale.

A row has no point when its x value or its y value is not a number, a date or a string. For example, `undefined` and `NaN` give no point. Such a row takes no focus, and its cell in the data table is empty.

## Series

The `series` channel divides the rows into series. Each series has a name, a group in the SVG and a column in the data table. The order of the series is the order of their first row in the data. Without `series`, the chart has one series without a name.

## Scales

`xScale` and `yScale` set the scale of each axis. Each one is an object with these fields:

- `type` is the scale function: `scaleLinear` (the default), `scaleTime` or `scaleBand`. Import it from its subpath. See [Scales](/docs/scales).
- `domain` gives the values at the two ends. Without it, the root uses the smallest and the largest value.
- `zero` extends the domain to include zero.
- `nice` extends the domain to round values, thus the first and the last tick are at the ends.
- `padding` is the space between two bands of a band scale, as a fraction of a step. The default is 0.2.

The y scale includes zero by default, because a bar starts at zero. Give `yScale={{ zero: false }}` for a line that must fill the plot. When the categories are on the y axis, the x scale includes zero by default. The default of `nice` is the same as the default of `zero`. `zero` does not change a `domain` that you give, but `nice` does. Give `nice: false` to keep the exact domain.

## Formats

`xFormat` and `yFormat` set the format of the values of each channel. The format applies to the names of the points, the ticks, the tooltip and the data table. A format is one of these:

- The options of `Intl.NumberFormat`, for a linear scale.
- The options of `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, for a time scale.
- A function that receives the value and returns the text. A time scale gives the function a `Date`, and a band scale gives the category.

`locale` sets the locale of all of the values. The default is the locale of the page.

Without a format, a tick label of a time scale shows only the largest calendar field that changes at the tick: "2025", "Mar", "Mar 5" or "9:00 AM". The name of a point shows the date in full, as precise as the data.

## Size and margin

- `height` is the height of the SVG in pixels. The default is 300.
- `width` is the width of the SVG in pixels. Without it, the chart follows the width of its container.
- `margin` is the space around the plot, in pixels. Without it, each axis measures its labels, and the root makes the margin of each side large enough for them.

You can give `margin` for some sides only, for example `margin={{ left: 48 }}`.

## Focus and selection

- `bind:focused` holds the point that has the focus, or `null`. The root writes it. It does not read it.
- `bind:selected` holds the selected point, or `null`. `Enter`, `Space` or a click selects a point, and a second time clears the selection. A click or a tap less than 40 pixels from a point also selects it.
- `onSelect` receives the point that the user activated.

A point is a `ChartPoint`. It has the row (`datum`) and the index of the row in the data of its mark. It also has the name of the series, and the x and y values. The row has the type of your data.

The selection follows the row index and the series of the point, not the identity of the row. Thus a `selected` value that you hold in a `$state` stays correct, although the state holds a proxy of the row.

## Accessible name

The chart needs an accessible name. Give it with one of these:

- A `Chart.Title`. The plot gets `aria-labelledby` with the id of the title.
- `aria-label` on `Chart.Root`. It replaces the title as the name.
- `aria-labelledby` on `Chart.Root`, with the id of an element of your page.

Give `aria-describedby` with the id of an element that describes the chart, for example a summary of the trend.

## Rendering on the server

The root makes the SVG on the server with `width`, or with a width of 640 pixels. After the mount, it measures the container.

- The scales on the server come from the `data` and the channels of the root. A chart with only root data has the correct scales in all orders of the parts.
- A mark with its own data or channels, and a stacked mark, add values when they start. On the server, the parts before them do not see these values. Give the `domain`, or put the mark before the guides.
- The margins on the server are the minimum margins, until the axes measure their labels in the browser. Give `width` and `margin`, and the chart does not move after the mount.
- Give a stable `id` to the root when the server makes the page. The ids of the parts come from it.

## Styles

The parts set these attributes for your styles:

| Part         | Attribute            | When                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Chart.Root` | `data-chart`         | Always.                                 |
| `Chart.Root` | `data-focus-within`  | A point of the chart has the focus.     |
| `Chart.Root` | `data-focus-visible` | The focused point shows the focus ring. |
| `Chart.Plot` | `data-plot`          | Always.                                 |

The attributes of the points are on the page of each mark.
