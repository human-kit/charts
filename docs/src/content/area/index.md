description: Chart.Area fills the space below each series, side by side or stacked — an accessible Svelte area chart with keyboard focus on every point.

<script>
	import { Demo, ApiReference } from '$lib/docs/components/index.js';
	import Hero from './demos/hero.svelte';
	import heroSource from './demos/hero.svelte?highlight';
	import Stacked from './demos/stacked.svelte';
	import stackedSource from './demos/stacked.svelte?highlight';
	import api from './api.json';
</script>

# Area

`Chart.Area` fills the space between each series and zero. Each row is a point on the top line of the area. The points are focus targets, but they show only when they have the focus.

<Demo source={heroSource}><Hero /></Demo>

## Anatomy

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { Chart } from '@human-kit/charts';
	import { scaleTime } from '@human-kit/charts/scales/time';
</script>

<Chart.Root data={rows} x="day" y="requests" xScale={{ type: scaleTime }}>
	<Chart.Title>Requests per day</Chart.Title>
	<Chart.Plot>
		<Chart.Area />
	</Chart.Plot>
</Chart.Root>
```

The mark makes a `<g>` with one group for each series. A series group holds a filled `<path>`, a `<path>` for the top line, and one `<circle>` for each point.

## Stacked

Give `stacked` to put the series one on the other. The bottom of each area is the top of the area before it. The y scale then includes the top of the stack.

<Demo source={stackedSource}><Stacked /></Demo>

Without `stacked`, each area starts at zero, and the areas can cover each other. Give the fill an opacity, so that the user can see all of the series.

A stack changes the domain of the y scale. On the server, a guide before the mark does not see the top of the stack. Thus put the mark before the guides, or give the `domain` of the y scale.

## Points

The default radius `r` is 0. The points are hidden, but they stay focus targets. The focused point gets the radius `focusRadius`, which is 4 pixels by default. Give `r` to show all of the points.

## Styles

Give each series a color with the CSS `color`. The filled path uses it as its fill, and the top line uses it as its stroke.

```css
.chart [data-area] {
	opacity: 0.2;
}

.chart [data-line] {
	stroke-width: 2;
}
```
