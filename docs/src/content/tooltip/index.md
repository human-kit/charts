# Tooltip

`Chart.Tooltip` shows the values of one point in a box near the point. It opens on the point under the pointer, and on the point that has the keyboard focus.

<Demo source={heroSource}><Hero /></Demo>

## Anatomy

```svelte
<Chart.Root data={rows} x="day" y="price">
	<Chart.Plot>
		<Chart.Line />
	</Chart.Plot>
	<Chart.Tooltip />
</Chart.Root>
```

The tooltip is HTML, thus it goes in `Chart.Root` and not in `Chart.Plot`. It makes a `<div>` with `position: absolute`. The root is its containing block.

## Open and close

- The pointer opens the tooltip on the nearest point, when the point is less than 40 pixels from the pointer.
- On a touch screen, a tap opens the tooltip on the nearest point. The tooltip stays when the finger lifts. A tap out of the plot closes it, and a finger that scrolls the page also closes it.
- Near an edge of the figure, the tooltip moves away from the point. It stays in the width of the figure, thus it does not make the page wider on a narrow screen.
- The keyboard focus opens the tooltip on the focused point. A focus from a pointer press does not open it.
- `Escape` closes the tooltip. A move to another point opens it again.

`offset` is the distance between the point and the tooltip, in pixels. The tooltip is above the point, and its middle is at the x position of the point.

## Content of your own

Without children, the tooltip shows the category or the x value, then the name of the series and the value. Give `children` to replace this content. The snippet receives the point and its values as text, in the formats of the chart.

<Demo source={customSource}><Custom /></Demo>

`point.datum` is the row. The tooltip does not know the type of your data, thus give the type to the row in the snippet.

## Accessibility

- The tooltip has `aria-hidden="true"`. A screen reader reads the name of the focused point, and the tooltip does not say it a second time.
- The tooltip never contains a control, and it never takes the focus. Do not put a link or a button in it.
- A value is never available only in the tooltip. Put the same information in the name of the points or in the data table.

| Box                 | `data-series`         | The name of the series of the point. |
| Line of the x value | `data-tooltip-key`    | Empty.                               |
| Line of the value   | `data-tooltip-value`  | Empty.                               |
| Name of the series  | `data-tooltip-series` | Empty.                               |

The last three attributes are on the default content only.
